### Hi there!

I'm [**Noor**], a computer science, statistics, and math student at the University of Toronto.

I’m passionate about building projects that combine machine learning, software engineering, and data-driven solutions. I’ve worked on personalized health analysis tools and Python applications for everyday productivity.

Outside of tech, I love exploring financial technology, following new developments in ML and healthcare, and finding ways to use technology for social impact.
